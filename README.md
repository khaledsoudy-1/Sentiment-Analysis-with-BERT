# Sentiment Analysis with BERT: A Beginner's Guide 🚀

This project provides a beginner-friendly guide to performing sentiment analysis using the powerful BERT model. We will cover the basics of BERT, demonstrate how to load a pre-trained model, and use it to classify the sentiment of text.

## Introduction 📖

Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text, such as positive 😄, negative 😠, or neutral 😐. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a state-of-the-art language model developed by Google. It has achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis. We'll be using a pre-trained BERT model to classify the sentiment of text.

## Project Structure 📂

The project is organized as follows:

* **Introduction to Sentiment Analysis with BERT.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the main code and explanations for sentiment analysis using BERT.
* **IMDB Dataset.csv:** Dataset containing movie reviews for sentiment analysis.
* **train.csv:** Dataset containing Arabic tweets for sentiment analysis.
* **README.md:** This file.

## Getting Started 🏁

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:** Open the `Introduction to Sentiment Analysis with BERT.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or your preferred Jupyter environment.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Install the necessary libraries using the provided code cells in the notebook.
3. **Run the Code:** Execute the code cells in the notebook sequentially to understand the steps involved in sentiment analysis with BERT.
4. **Explore the Datasets:** Examine the `IMDB Dataset.csv` and `train.csv` files to understand the data used for sentiment analysis.
   - **IMDB Dataset:** This dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews for English sentiment analysis. It can be downloaded from Kaggle: [IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).
   - **train.csv:** This file, included in this repository, contains Arabic tweets labeled for sentiment analysis tasks. You can find it directly in the repository.

## Model Selection 🧠

For English sentiment analysis, we use the `nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment` pre-trained BERT model. For Arabic sentiment analysis, we use the `CAMeL-Lab/bert-base-arabic-camelbert-mix-sentiment` model.

## Usage Examples 💡

The notebook includes examples of sentiment analysis for both English and Arabic text. You can modify the input text and experiment with different datasets.

## Limitations ⚠️

The current implementation using `nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment` has a limitation: it doesn't effectively support Arabic sentiment analysis. We recommend using a dedicated Arabic BERT model or fine-tuning a multilingual model for better results.

## Conclusion ✅

This project provides a starting point for exploring sentiment analysis with BERT. You can further extend it by applying it to different datasets, fine-tuning models for specific tasks, and exploring other NLP techniques.
